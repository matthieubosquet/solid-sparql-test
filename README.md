# Solid SPARQL

Since [Comunica and Solid are compatible](https://comunica.dev/docs/query/advanced/solid/), you can use it to run SPARQL queries over your pod resources. 

## TODO

Use Solid specific HTTP actor https://github.com/comunica/actor-http-solid-auth-fetch to query over data pods that require authentication.
